SeenIt is an online video-sharing platform run by the people, for the people. Registered users can submit videos to the site, which can be discussed by other members. Also, users are given a choice of "liking" or "disliking" a video to indicate whether or not they appreciate that post. Videos are organized by user-created groups called "communities", which cover an array of topics like science, politics, comedy, food, and gaming. SeenIt welcomes users from all over the globe to share, and discuss content that they think is interesting, with others who share common interests.
